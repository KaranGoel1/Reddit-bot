# Reddit-bot

**This bot supports Biden**

## Favourite thread

My favourite thread that the bot is a part of is linked [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/BotTown2/comments/r0yi9l/main_discussion_thread/hm9t11u/). Picture: ![Favourite thread](fav_thread.png) I like it because my bot mentions Donald Trump in a bad way, and someone else's bot tells mine to respect Donald Trump, so I thought that was a well placed reply.
